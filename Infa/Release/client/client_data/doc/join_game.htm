        <p align="justify">At first you need to find a game to join. Click the &quot;Find
          Game&quot; button.
          A window with settings appears. </p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Game type</strong> -
          choose the gamemode: a search in a labyrinth or a battle. For details about gamemodes see <a href="gtypes.htm">game types </a>.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Server IP</strong> - IP-address of the server where the game will run.  If the server is on your computer you need to input 127.0.0.1. If you want to add new server to the list, select &quot;<strong>Add server</strong>&quot; from the menu, input the new server IP and click &quot;Add&quot;.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Server
            port</strong> - the port server uses. Default value is 51000. Don't change this value if you're unsure what you're doing!</p>
        <p align="justify">After you press the <strong>&quot;Find game&quot;</strong> button in a window to the left you'll see the list of available games. There will be shown the <strong>Name</strong> of the game, full number of players in the <strong> Number</strong> field and current number of players in the <strong>Current</strong> field.</p>
        <p align="justify">For joining the game choose one from the list.
          Then fill the <strong>Game logik</strong> field with a path to the file with your robot logic. About writing the logic see <a href="logic_ed.htm">here</a>. The robot language is described in the <a href="language.htm"> Language overview</a></p>
        <p align="justify">After you've brought in all the necessary data, the &quot;<strong>Join game</strong>&quot; button becomes available. On pressing this button you connect to the server and join the game you've chosen. If everything goes right you'll see a window saying &quot;Waiting&quot;. When the necessary number of players joins the game you'll see a picture of your robot and everything it sees and it knows. In this window you may watch the game, the actions of your robot and the other ones. In the and of the game there will be a message about the winner.</p>
