        <p align="justify">For playing you need two things. First, the gameclient application. If you're reading this manual you already have it. :). The second thing you need is access to the game server. Two variants are possible here. Either you know the IP-address of a computer,
          where it already runs, or you are going to run it on your own machine.  If you are going to install your own server, refer to the <a href="server.htm">corresponding section</a>. (Don't be afraid, it's pretty simple and won't take more than 5-10 minutes.)</p>
        <p align="justify">After you have these two things, a question appears: How to play? This is a bit more complicated. :) You can not control your robot in a way you usually do it in games, using keyboard or mouse. Instead you need to write the robot logic before the game starts. After that you'll see the robot acting according to your instructions. </p>
        <p align="justify">You write the logic using the internal language . It allows to specify the robot commands in an intuitively evident way, for example:</p>
        <p align="justify">If ( CanGoLeft ) {<br>
          StepLeft<br>
          }</p>
        <p align="justify">Detailed information about the robot language you'll find in the <a href="language.htm"> Language overview</a> section. There are also some ready-made examples of logic there.</p>
      </blockquote>
      </div>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify">After you have a file with logic, you may proceed directly to the game. You may <a href="new_game.htm"> create a new game </a>, or <a href="join_game.htm">join an existing game</a>. For more details see the links.</p>
        <p align="justify">We hope you'll find the game interesting . :)</p>
