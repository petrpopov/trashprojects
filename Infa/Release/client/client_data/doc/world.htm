        <p align="justify">The game is turn-based. Map is a cell field.
          Each cell is either free, or occupied by a wall (you cannot pass it),
          or taken by some kind of object (f.e., robot or finish). In a cell there can be only one object at a time. All the attempts of placing two objects into the same cell are processed in a corresponding way: a robot picks up an object, robots collide receiving damage and so on.</p>
        <p align="justify"> In the beginning a robot knows nothing about the map, but it remembers the places it has already been to. A robot is equipped with cameras, but they allow to observe just the close surroundings (let's say it's dark in the gamezone or there is a thick fog). The use of radar sets is prohibited by the rules, so the robot has to act having little information about the environment. As a little compensation the rules allow robots to have good hearing, so that they can find out where the opponents are (all the robots produce loud noises when moving).</p>
