        <p align="justify">&quot;Labyrinth&quot; gamemode is meant for creating logic of searching in a rather complicated labyrinth. In this mode there is no shooting but the robots still may collide and get damage to the extent of full destruction. Whomever is the first at finish wins. If all the robots have died there is a draw. There is also a draw announced, if noone succeeds during 1000 moves. :)</p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;Kill'em all!&quot; gamemode is meant for creating logic of staying alive in a battle. :) The winner is the last to  stay alive. A draw is announced, if noone wins during 1000 moves. :)</p>
