          <p>What is a  waypoint? In this case waypoint means an entrance into an unexplored corridor. In other words it is such a known cell within the robot's reach which has at least one unexplored cell next to it. A robot remembers the list of such cells and renews it on every turn. We may assign waypoint`s priorities according to some logic and then choose the waypoint with the highest priority and head towards it. These are the functions for working with the waypoints:</p>
          <p><strong>IsDefinedWaypoint</strong> - this function returns <strong>true</strong> if a robot already has an active waypoint and it still has not reached it. In any other case the function returns <strong>false</strong>. This function is useful if you don't want to take any other actions before you reach a waypoint you have once defined as active.</p>
          <p><strong>SetWaypointsPriority ( equation )</strong> - the function sets priorities to all known waypoints according to an equation it has been given as an argument. In this equation you may use <a href="properties.htm">any properties </a>, integer numbers, operators +,-,*,/, and also brackets.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Example: SetWaypointsPriority ( Waypoints.MaxDist - Waypoint.Distance ). Each waypoint this way will get as a priority the difference between the distance toward the farthest waypoint and the distance toward the current one. So the closest waypoint will receive the highest priority. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>GetWaypoint</strong> - this function chooses a waypoint with the highest priority and defines it as active. </p>
          <p><strong>GoToWaypoint</strong> - makes robot step toward the waypoint which was defined as active.
