        <p align="justify">Click the &quot;Create New Game&quot; button. A settings window will appear. </p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Game type</strong> - choose the gamemode: a search in a labyrinth or a battle. For details about gamemodes see <a href="gtypes.htm">game types </a>.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Game name </strong>- the name of the game :). When other players join the game you created, they'll see this name.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Number of players </strong>- The game will start only when the necessary number of players joins it. You may specify it as 1 and play just for yourself.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Game logik</strong> - the path to a file with your robot logic. About writing the logic see <a href="logic_ed.htm">here</a>. The robot language is described in the <a href="language.htm"> Language overview</a></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Server IP</strong> - IP-address of the server where the game will run.  If the server is on your computer you need to input 127.0.0.1. If you want to add new server to the list, select &quot;<strong>Add server</strong>&quot; from the menu, input the new server IP and click &quot;Add&quot;. </p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Server port</strong> - the port server uses. Default value is 51000. Don't change this value if you're unsure what you're doing!</p>
        <p align="justify">You can not choose the map for the game. It will be chosen randomly by the server from all the maps it has. We think that's more honest. The point is that the players won't write the logic designed especially for a certain map and a certain situation. If you don't have the necessary map on your computer it will be automatically loaded from the server.</p>
        <p align="justify">After you've brought in all the necessary data, the &quot;<strong>Create
          game</strong>&quot; button becomes available. On pressing this button you connect to the server and create a game on it. If everything goes right you'll see a window saying &quot;Waiting&quot;. When the necessary number of players joins the game you'll see a picture of your robot and everything it sees and it knows. In this window you may watch the game, the actions of your robot and the other ones. In the and of the game there will be a message about the winner.</p>
