          <p>NPRG stands for &quot;Network Programmable Robot Game&quot;.
            Although it can hardly be called a game in the ordinary sense. It's more of an intellectual entertaiment like crosswords. :)</p>
        </div>
        <div align="justify">
          <p>Here is the point of the game. You have a robot in an unexplored labyrinth.
            There also are your opponents' robots there. The player wins if his robot is first at the finish (in the &quot;Labyrinth&quot; gamemode), or if his robot is the last to stay alive (in the &quot;Kill`em all!&quot; gamemode).</p>
          <p>The feature of the game is that you cannot control your robot directly
            using keyboard or mouse. You assign it's logic and it acts  following your instructions.</p>
          <p>For more information about this application, about creating a new game or joining an existing game, you may refer to <a href="general.htm">&quot;What
            is NPRG?&quot;</a> section.</p>
          <p>To find out about different gamemodes and how to control your robot see... <a href="control.htm">&quot;Controlling
            your robot&quot;</a>.</p>
          <p>Detailed descriptions of all the language functions you can use to create the robot logic you'll find in the <a href="language.htm">&quot;Language overview&quot;</a>.</p>
          <p align="right">Have fun! :)</p>
