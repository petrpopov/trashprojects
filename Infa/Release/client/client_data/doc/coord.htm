        <p align="justify">Robot has two ways of orientation: by means of standard Cartesian coordinates
          (X,Y) and by directions (something like polar coordinates). Both coordinate systems are relative, that is to say they turn whenever the robot turns (see the illustrations).</p>
        <p align="justify">In the Cartesian coordinates  X axis goes from left to right of the robot,
          and the Y axis - bottom-upwards (relatively too). Point of origin is the robot itself. 
          In other words the first cell to the right of the robot has the coordinates (1,0), the first cell behind is (0,-1), the closest cell left-and-ahead is (-1,1), the second ahead is (0,2) and so on.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the polar coordinates robot orientates by numbers of the rays. The rays are numbered clockwise starting with the ahead direction. The ray going straight ahead of the robot has number 1, the ray going right - number 10, the ray going backwards
          - number
          19, the ray going left - number 28. The last ray's number is 36. (see the picture)</p>
